## What's ChatGuard?
**ChatGuard** is a Minecraft plugin designed for servers running version b1.7.3. It cancels player messages containing blocked terms or matching RegEx patterns, logs actions (via Discord webhooks, console, or local files), prevents chat spam, issues temporary mutes (requires [Essentials v2.5.8](https://github.com/AleksandarHaralanov/ChatGuard/raw/refs/heads/master/libs/Essentials.jar)), and enforces escalating penalties via a six strike tier system. The plugin is entirely configurable to the operator's liking.

  rules:              # Configuration for blocking rules.
    regex: []         # List of regular expressions used for blocking messages.
    terms:            # Configuration for blocking specific terms.

```

> [!CAUTION]
> ðŸ”– **v2.3.0**: If your server is not running Essentials v2.5.8 or newer, make sure to download and install it. Without it, the entire plugin will break, and in-game messages will fail to send properly. You can find the download [here](#requirements) in the requirements heading.

#### Strikes
The default `strikes.yml` configuration file is initially empty. When a player joins for the first time after ChatGuard is installed on the server, they are added to the configuration with 0 strikes. From there, the plugin manages their strikes, incrementing them up to a maximum of 5 as necessary. Read note below on how that works.

> [!NOTE]
> ðŸ”– **v2.3.0**: Strike tiers will increment only when the filter is enabled, and a disallowed term or matching regex pattern is detected in a message. Otherwise, all strike tiers will default to 0 unless manually modified in the configuration file or through the included command.
