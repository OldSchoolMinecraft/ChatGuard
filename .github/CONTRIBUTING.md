## Coding Conventions
When reading the code, you'll quickly get the hang of it. Focus on optimizing for readability:

- Use an indentation of four spaces whenever possible; however, two spaces are also acceptable if preferred.
- Always include spaces after list items and method parameters (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (e.g., `x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
- This is open-source. Keep in mind the people who will read your code â€” make it clean and easy to understand.
- If you feel the need to add comments, don't hesitate; they are always appreciated.
- Please avoid leaving zombie code behind. 
- Following general Java conventions is recommended as a rule of thumb.
