## Coding Conventions
This is open-source project. Keep in mind the people who will read your code â€” make it clean and easy to understand.
When reading the code, you'll quickly get the hang of it. Focus on optimizing for readability:

- Use an indentation of four spaces whenever possible; however, two spaces are also acceptable if preferred.
- Always include spaces after list items and method parameters (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (e.g., `x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
- If you feel the need to add comments, don't hesitate; they are always appreciated.
- Avoid utilizing algorithms with bad space and time complexity. The chat's responsiveness is VERY important.
  - Read about Big O notation [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation).
- Do not leave zombie code behind. 

Following general Java conventions is generally recommended as a best practice.
